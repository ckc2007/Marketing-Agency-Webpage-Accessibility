## User Story

```
AS AN SEO and online marketing agency
I WANT code that reflects up-to-date accessibility standards
SO THAT our site is an example of accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN the website reflects correct accessbility standards
WHEN I examine the website source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the HTML elements form and format
THEN I see a logical structure, format and semantic flow
WHEN I view image elements
THEN I find alt attributes that accurately and succinctly describe the images
WHEN I view the h attributes (headings)
THEN THEY appear with the correct positioning, and are listed under their corresponding sections on the .css sheet
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find an easy to read, terse, tagline description of what the company does (what is the webpage about?)
```

## Mock-Up

This is how the final website should appear - styling and positioning of each element is represented here.:

![The Horiseon webpage has a logo with color elements applied to the 'seo' segment of the brand name, navigation elements are on the top right, the main section contains three main topics that represent the main focus of the page and what Horiseon is all about, and a side bar to the right that includes additional information regarding things the company represents (to reinforce the main section, and a branded tagline at the footer with a copyright element).](./assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)
